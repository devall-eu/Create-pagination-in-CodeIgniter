# Create-pagination-in-CodeIgniter
For pages with many hits, it is recommended to use pagination as the page is more transparent and loads much faster. We can determine the number of hits per page.

We can pagination class customize, either dynamically or via stored preferences. 

To get started, we need the total number of hits, the whole URI, the number of hits per page, and information which segment of your URI contains the page number.
